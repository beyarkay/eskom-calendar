          2. Find the `ics` calendar file corresponding to your area (use ctrl-f to search quickly).
          3. Right-click on the file and copy the link:

          ![Right click and copy image](https://github.com/beyarkay/eskom-calendar/blob/main/imgs/copy-link.png)

          5. Open your calendar app (Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar, etc) and paste the calendar link in your app's `subscribe to calendar` option:


          | [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/settings/addbyurl)  | [Outlook](https://outlook.office.com/calendar/addcalendar) | [Apple Calendar](https://support.apple.com/en-za/guide/calendar/icl1022/mac) |

          That's it! 


          ### Details

          Now you've got loadshedding warnings in your calendar that tell you if the power will be off or not. This is better than apps like EskomSePush because it combines what area you're in with your area's loadshedding schedule. You'll only be notified if

          1. there's national loadshedding announced by Eskom *and*

          2. your area has loadshedding scheduled for that time.

          ### Developers

          There's also a machine-friendly csv file that contains loadshedding information. Have a look at the [`README.md`](https://github.com/beyarkay/eskom-calendar/tree/latest) for ideas!
