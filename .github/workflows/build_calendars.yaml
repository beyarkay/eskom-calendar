        body: "To get your loadshedding schedule in your calendar you should

          1. scroll down to the blue links under `Assets`

          2. Find the `ics` calendar file corresponding to your area

          3. Right-click on the file and copy the link

          4. Open your calendar app (Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar, etc)

          5. Paste the calendar link in your app's `subscribe to calendar` option.
          
          If you use Google Calendar, just 
          [click here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/settings/addbyurl) 
          and paste the link.


          That's it! Now you've got loadshedding warning in your calendar that
          tell you if the power will be off or not. This is better than apps
          like EskomSePush because it combines what area you're in with your
          area's loadshedding schedule.

          You'll only be notified if


          1. there's national loadshedding announced by Eskom and

          2. your area has loadshedding scheduled for that time.

          It's also open source! We depend on pull requests to update
          `manually_specified.yaml` with the latest schedule. Please submit a
          PR if Eskom announces a change!
