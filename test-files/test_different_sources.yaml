# YAML Historical Loadshedding Test Document
# ==========================================
#
# This is a YAML test file that contains multiple YAML documents. Each document
# starts with `---`. This file is used to test that historical loadshedding
# calculations are correct.
#
# If there are N documents, then the first N-1 each specify a historical state
# of loadshedding, with the most recent documents towards the end of the list.
# The last document is the result of the previous N-1 documents being combined
# together.
#
# Test what happens with different sources
# ----------------------------------------
# Check that multiple sources are combined properly
